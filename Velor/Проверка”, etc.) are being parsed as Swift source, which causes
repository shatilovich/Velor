- Cannot find '' in scope
- Expected expression
- Expressions are not allowed at the top level

Fix: Remove everything after the #Preview block so the file ends right after the preview closure. The correct end of the file should be:

```swift:ContentView.swift
#Preview {
    ContentView()
        .preferredColorScheme(.dark)
}
